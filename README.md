# Fwitter File Structure

Here's the file structure we'll be using to build out our own version of Twitter - "Fwitter". 
For each file and directory, think about the following questions:

+ What are the responsibilities of this file?
+ What does the code in the file do?
+ How might we change this file to extend/enhance our application?
